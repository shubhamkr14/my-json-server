You might be working on a project on your bootcamp and you’d want to host your DB.json file online and fetch as an api instead of a local host file. You’ve come to the right place.


Getting Started
Go to https://render.com/ and sign up, it is easier just to link it with your GitHub account.
Give your credit card details, they always refund the cash after SignUp so no stress.
Go ahead and fork, then clone my repository (https://github.com/derrickmomanyi/JSON-SERVER). This is the easier method, I’ve already added all the necessary files. Just change the DB.json and add your data. Then push to github.
If you want to do all the processes yourself, follow the process below.
Adding deployment files yourself
1. Create a folder
mkdir <projectname>-mock-api
cd <projectname>-mock-api
2. Step 1: Create a node js project
npm init -y
3. Install a json server dependency
npm i json-server
4. Create server.js
const jsonServer = require('json-server')

const server = jsonServer.create()

const router = jsonServer.router('db.json')
const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults()
 
server.use(middlewares)
server.use('/api', router)
server.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000, () => {
  console.log('JSON Server is running')
})
5. Create db.json
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Example Article",
      "content": "This is an example."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Second Article",
      "content": "This is also an example."
    },
    {
      "title": "Third Article",
      "content": "Another example!",
      "id": 3
    }
  ]
}
